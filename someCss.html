		<p style="font-family:verdana;"> My name is Gabriel Brian Rishwain. I was born in Santa Monica, California on April 22, 1997 to Erin and Brian Rishwain. I have two younger brothers named Julian and Luke. I also have a poodle named Ringo. I am very close with my family and consider myself very blessed to have the relationships I do with my family.</p>
		<p style="font-family:courier;"> At the age of 5, I started Kindergarten at St. Charles Borromeo in North Hollywood. I went there all the way through 8th grade and then I attended Notre Dame High School for high school. I played basketball my entire life all the way through high school. </p>
